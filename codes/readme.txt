	--visualizeStructure.py: It generates an image to visualize a given tiling scheme.

	First step is to extract the tilingSchemes.zip into its same folder. 

	Second step is the visualization. 
	For example, in order to visualize the 55-th tiling scheme in the set of S3, you can use the argument as follows:
	python3 visualizeStructure.py 55 3
	
	Here the first argument represents the tiling scheme (55) in the set of the given second argument (3).
